	abstract = {We investigate the quasi-static growth of a fluid-driven frictional shear crack that propagates in mixed mode (II+III) on a planar fault interface that separates two identical half-spaces of a three-dimensional solid. The fault interface is characterized by a shear strength equal to the product of a constant friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Fluid is injected into the fault interface and two different injection scenarios are considered: injection at constant volume rate and injection at constant pressure. We derive analytical solutions for circular ruptures which occur in the limit of a Poisson's ratio ν=0 and solve numerically for the more general case in which the rupture shape is unknown (ν≠0). For an injection at constant volume rate, the fault slip growth is self-similar. The rupture radius (ν=0) expands as R(t)=λL(t), where L(t) is the nominal position of the fluid pressure front and λ is an amplification factor that is a known function of a unique dimensionless parameter T. The latter is defined as the ratio between the distance to failure under ambient conditions and the strength of the injection. Whenever λ>1, the rupture front outpaces the fluid pressure front. For ν≠0, the rupture shape is quasi-elliptical. The aspect ratio is upper and lower bounded by 1/(1−ν) and (3−ν)/(3−2ν), for the limiting cases of critically stressed faults (λ≫1, T≪1) and marginally pressurized faults (λ≪1, T≫1), respectively. Moreover, the evolution of the rupture area is independent of the Poisson's ratio and grows simply as Ar(t)=4παλ2t, where α is the fault hydraulic diffusivity. For injection at constant pressure, the fault slip growth is not self-similar: the rupture front evolves at large times as ∝(αt)(1−T)/2 with T between 0 and 1. The frictional rupture moves at most diffusively (∝αt) when the fault is critically stressed, but in general propagates slower than the fluid pressure front. Yet in some conditions, the rupture front outpaces the fluid pressure front. The latter will eventually catch the former if injection is sustained for sufficient time. Our findings provide a basic understanding on how stable (aseismic) ruptures propagate in response to fluid injection in 3-D. Notably, since aseismic ruptures driven by injection at constant rate expand proportionally to the squared root of time, seismicity clouds that are commonly interpreted to be controlled by the direct effect of fluid pressure increase might be controlled by the stress transfer of a propagating aseismic rupture instead. We also demonstrate that the aseismic moment M0 scales to the injected fluid volume V as M0∝V3/2.},

	abstract = { Injection-induced aseismic slip plays an important role in a broad range of human-made and natural systems, from the exploitation of geo-resources to the understanding of earthquakes. Recent studies have shed light on how aseismic slip propagates in response to continuous fluid injections. Yet much less is known about the response of faults after the injection of fluids has stopped. In this work, we investigate via a hydro-mechanical model the propagation and ultimate arrest of aseismic slip during the so-called post-injection stage. We show that after shut-in, fault slip propagates in pulse-like mode. The conditions that control the propagation as a pulse and notably when and where the ruptures arrest are fully established. In particular, critically stressed faults can host rupture pulses that propagate for several orders of magnitude the injection duration and reach up to nearly double the size of the ruptures at the moment of shut-in. We consequently argue that the persistent stressing of increasingly larger rock volumes caused by post-injection aseismic slip is a plausible mechanism for the triggering of post-injection seismicity---a critical issue in the geo-energy industry. Our physical model shows quantitative agreement with field observations of documented cases of post-injection induced seismicity. },

@article{Saez_Lecampion_2024,
	abstract = {We investigate the propagation of fluid-driven fault slip on a slip-weakening frictional interface separating two identical half-spaces of a three-dimensional elastic solid. Our focus is on axisymmetric circular shear ruptures as they capture the most essential aspects of the dynamics of unbounded ruptures in three dimensions. In our model, fluid-driven aseismic slip occurs in two modes: as an interfacial rupture that is unconditionally stable, or as the quasi-static nucleation phase of an otherwise dynamic rupture. Unconditionally stable ruptures progress through four stages. Initially, ruptures are diffusively self-similar and the interface behaves as if it were governed by a constant friction coefficient equal to the static friction value. Slip then accelerates due to frictional weakening while the cohesive zone develops. Once the latter gets properly localized, a finite amount of fracture energy emerges along the interface. The rupture dynamics is then governed by an energy balance of the Griffith's type. In this stage, fault slip transitions from a large-toughness to a small-toughness regime due to the diminishing effect of the fracture energy in the near-front energy balance. Ultimately, self-similarity is recovered and the fault behaves again as having a constant friction coefficient, but this time equal to the dynamic friction value. This condition is equivalent to a fault interface operating to leading order with zero fracture energy. When slow slip is the result of a frustrated dynamic instability, slip also initiates self-similarly at a constant peak friction coefficient. The maximum size that aseismic ruptures can reach before becoming unstable can be as small as a critical nucleation radius (shear modulus divided by the slip-weakening rate) and as large as infinity when faults are close to a well-defined limit that separates the two modes of aseismic sliding. In the former case, earthquake nucleation occurs unaffected by the dynamic friction coefficient. In contrast, the latter case exhibits fracture-mechanics behavior, characterized by a finite influx of elastic strain energy being supplied to and dissipated at the rupture front. We provide analytical and numerical solutions for the problem solved over its full dimensionless parameter space, including expressions for relevant length and time scales characterizing the transition between different stages and regimes. Due to its three-dimensional nature, the model enables quantitative comparisons with field observations as well as preliminary engineering design of hydraulic stimulation operations. Existing laboratory and in-situ experiments of fluid injection into simulated and natural faults are briefly discussed in light of our results.},
