New PhD paper just out! Find it with open access in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2022.0810">Link</a>. We elaborate on theoretical aspects of how aseismic slip keeps propagating after stopping a fluid injection, and how the stress perturbation associated with it can potentially trigger seismicity for long time (say months) after these operations stop.
