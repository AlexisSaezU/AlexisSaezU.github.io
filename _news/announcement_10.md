New paper from my PhD! Interested in how big injection-induced slow slip events can be? Check out our recently published paper in Science Advances: <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq0662">Link</a>. We elaborate on the physical factors controlling the maximum size and moment magnitude of this class of events, and why quantifying the size of these events is important to better understand the seismic hazard posed by anthropogenic subsurface fluid injections in the geo-energy industry.
