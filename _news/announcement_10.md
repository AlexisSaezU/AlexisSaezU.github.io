New paper from my PhD! Interested in how big injection-induced slow slip events can be? Check out our paper in Science Advances journal: <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq0662">Link</a>. We elaborated on the physical factors controlling the maximum size and moment magnitude of this class of events, and why quantifying their size is important to better understand the seismic hazard posed by subsurface fluid-injection operations in the geo-energy industry.
