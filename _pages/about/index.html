My doctoral research has primarily focused on the mechanics of fluid-driven frictional ruptures and their applications to injection-induced seismicity. Currently, I am also working on slow earthquakes and pore pressure transients along subduction zones. In general, my research approach consists of using tools of theoretical and computational continuum (solid and fluid) mechanics to understand the interplay between different physical processes involved in both natural and human-induced earthquakes. I test these physical models against available data from both laboratory experiments and field observations.</p> </body></html>
