Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech, working with <a href='https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/jean-philippe-avouac'>Prof. Jean-Philippe Avouac</a>. Before coming here, I obtained my PhD in Mechanics (Dec.2023) from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where I was advised by <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/gel/'>Prof. Brice Lecampion</a>.

My doctoral research focused primarily on the mechanics of fluid-driven frictional ruptures and their applications to injection-induced seismicity. While I keep currently working and collaborating with colleagues around these topics, I am now largely focused on understanding some problems in earthquake science. By combining theory and observations, I am trying to better constrain the physical mechanisms underlying slow earthquakes and the segmentation of slow and fast ruptures along major plate-tectonic boundaries, among various other topics.

In general, my research uses tools of theoretical and computational continuum (solid and fluid) mechanics to understand the mechanical behavior of the subsurface, in relation to problems associated with the development of underground technologies for the energy transition such as deep geothermal energy and geological carbon storage, and the mitigation of geo-hazards such as earthquakes. I inform these physical models with data from both laboratory experiments and geophysical observations.
