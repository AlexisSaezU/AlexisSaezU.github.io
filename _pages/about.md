Hello! I am a doctoral candidate at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. I have wide interests ranging from the mechanics of friction and fractures in geomaterials to the physics of earthquakes and faulting. Currently, I'm focused on understanding coupled hydro-mechanical processes in faults and fractured rocks. Generally, I use tools of theoretical and computational mechanics to understand the interplay between different physical processes involved in both natural and human-induced earthquakes.
