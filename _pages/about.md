I am a doctoral candidate in Mechanics at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. During my PhD, my research has focused on the mechanics of fluid-driven frictional ruptures and its applications to injection-induced seismicity. More recently, I have been working on the mechanics of slow earthquakes in subduction zones. Generally speaking, I use tools of theoretical and computational continuum (solid and fluid) mechanics to understand the interplay between different physical processes involved in both natural and human-induced earthquakes.
