I am a doctoral candidate in Mechanics at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. My doctoral research has primarily focused on the mechanics of fluid-driven frictional ruptures and their applications to injection-induced seismicity. Currently, I am also working on slow earthquakes and pore pressure transients in subduction zones. In general, I use tools of theoretical and computational continuum (solid and fluid) mechanics to understand the interplay between different physical processes at play in the problems I am concern with. This includes phenomena and applications that are relevant to both earthquake science and subsurface energy-related technologies. I test these physical models against available data from both laboratory experiments and field observations.
