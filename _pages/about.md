I am a doctoral candidate in Mechanics at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. During my PhD, I have worked on the mechanics of fluid-driven frictional ruptures and its applications to injection-induced seismicity. Currently, I am also working on slow earthquakes in subduction zones. Generally speaking, I use tools of theoretical and computational continuum (solid and fluid) mechanics to understand the interplay between different physical processes involved in both natural and human-induced earthquakes. I test these models against available experimental and observational data.
