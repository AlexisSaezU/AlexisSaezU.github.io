Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech, working in the group of <a href='https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/jean-philippe-avouac'>Prof. Jean-Philippe Avouac</a>. I obtained my PhD in Mechanics (Dec.2023) from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where I was advised by <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/gel/'>Prof. Brice Lecampion</a>.

During my doctoral studies, my research focused primarily on the mechanics of fluid-driven frictional ruptures and their applications to injection-induced seismicity. While I keep working and collaborating with colleagues around these exciting topics, I am currently largely focused on understanding some fundamental problems in earthquake science. By combining theory and observations, I am trying to understand the physical mechanisms underlying slow earthquakes and the segmentation of earthquakes along subduction zones, among various other topics. 

In general, I use tools of theoretical and computational continuum (solid and fluid) mechanics to develop multi-physical models for problems that are relevant to both earthquake science and subsurface energy-related technologies (e.g., geothermal energy and CO2 sequestration). I test these physical models against data from both laboratory experiments and geophysical observations.
