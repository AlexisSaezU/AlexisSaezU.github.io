Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech, working in the group of <a href='https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/jean-philippe-avouac'>Prof. Jean-Philippe Avouac</a>. I obtained my PhD (Dec.2023) in Mechanics from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where I was advised by <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/gel/'>Prof. Brice Lecampion</a>.

My doctoral research focused primarily on the mechanics of fluid-driven frictional ruptures and their applications to injection-induced seismicity. While I keep working and collaborating with colleagues around these topics, I am currently mostly focused on some fundamental problems in earthquake science. By combining theory and observations, I am trying to understand the physical mechanisms underlying slow earthquakes and the segmentation of earthquakes along subduction zones. 

In general, I use tools of theoretical and computational continuum (solid and fluid) mechanics to understand the interplay between different physical processes at play, in problems that are relevant to both earthquake science and subsurface energy-related technologies. I test these physical models against available data from both laboratory experiments and geophysical observations.
