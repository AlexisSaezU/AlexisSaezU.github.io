I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech, working in the group of <a href='https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/jean-philippe-avouac'>Prof. Jean-Philippe Avouac</a>. I obtained my PhD (Dec. 2023) in Mechanics from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where I was advised by <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/gel/'>Prof. Brice Lecampion</a>.

My doctoral research has primarily focused on the mechanics of fluid-driven frictional ruptures and their applications to injection-induced seismicity. Currently, I am also working on slow earthquakes and pore pressure transients in subduction zones. In general, I use tools of theoretical and computational continuum (solid and fluid) mechanics to understand the interplay between different physical processes at play, in problems that are relevant to both earthquake science and subsurface energy-related technologies. I test these physical models against available data from both laboratory experiments and field observations.
